# SpaceInvadersGame
Important decisions I have made:
1. Incapsulate code for movement of the invaders and placing the invaders in separate class, which makes possible to use them in Invaders and Mothership classes
   and use them beyond this project;
2. Incapsulate handling of input in separate class.

Problems:
1. Finding of appropriate way to set types of invaders in their's cell place.
2. Destroying of motherships. Need to create method in Motherships class.

If I had have more time, I would improve architecture of project.
